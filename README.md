# GitHub Tutorial Repository

This repository serves as a tutorial for leveraging pre-commit hooks in Python and data science projects. Pre-commit hooks are a useful way to automate checks and tasks before committing code changes, helping maintain code quality and consistency throughout your project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tutorial-repo.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up pre-commit hooks:


This command will set up the pre-commit hooks defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

4. Start working on your project, making changes and writing code.

## Pre-commit Hooks

This tutorial repository includes a set of pre-commit hooks that are commonly used in Python and data science projects. These hooks help ensure code quality, enforce formatting guidelines, and perform various checks before each commit. The following hooks are included:

- **Black**: Enforces Python code formatting using the Black code formatter.

- **Flake8**: Checks Python code for style and potential errors using the Flake8 linter.

- **Mypy**: Performs static type checking on Python code using the Mypy tool.

- **Isort**: Sorts Python imports automatically for better organization and readability.

- **Nbconvert**: Clears the output of Jupyter Notebook files before committing them.

Feel free to explore the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the repository to customize or add additional pre-commit hooks based on your project's needs.
